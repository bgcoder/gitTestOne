                <p>Shut up, K-9! I might've been saying something important. I was saying something important! Well, 
                my Doctorate is purely honorary and Harry is only qualified to work on sailors. Are you listening to me? 
                Have a jelly baby. Come on! You may be a doctor. But I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. 
                Hello-o-o-o. You're standing on my scarf. Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point being 
                grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very 
                sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing speed. Even if you order them to kill you. 
                So if you do happen to change your mind, it's very difficult to stop them from obeying the original order. 
                But not impossible.</p>
                <p>Are you listening to me? Well, my Doctorate is purely honorary and Harry is only qualified to work on 
                sailors. You may be a doctor. But I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. It seems you have a very 
                large rat Brigadier—maybe you should employ the services of a very large cat? Shut up, K-9! Well, of course 
                I'm being childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. Would you like a jelly 
                baby? I might've been saying something important. I was saying something important!</p>
                <p>It may be irrational of me, but human beings are my favorite species. You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! 
                Shut up, K-9! Are you listening to me? You're standing on my scarf. Have a jelly baby. You may be a doctor. 
                But I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point 
                being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. Would you like a jelly baby? What?! Come out. And don't touch 
                anything! It seems you have a very large rat Brigadier—maybe you should employ the services of a very large cat?
